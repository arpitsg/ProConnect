# A brief description of your backend and front end :
For the frontend part of the project, we have used HTML, CSS and Javascript. Advantage of using these languages is that they are supported by all browsers and they can be integrated with any backend framework. Also, they are lightweight and thus make the system faster.
For styling purposes, we used Bootstrap and Google Fonts. The advantage of using these frameworks in the frontend is that they help in creating responsive designs much faster than without them. They also provide cross-browser compatibility.
For the backend, we used Python with the Django framework. One of the biggest advantages of using the Django framework is that it is independent and complete in itself. It does not require any external solution. Django is everything from ORM to the web browser itself. Also codes in Django Framework are ‘Keep It Short and Simple’ and ‘Don’t repeat yourself’ compliant. Moreover, python also opens up the possibility to use machine learning or AI based components in the project.
As a database language we chose sqlite. Reasons for using this database language in place of others like MySQL and PostgreSQL are that sqlite is lightweight and thus provides better performance, does not require installation, is reliable and portable.
For version control and collaboration we used git and github respectively, github made communication between the team members very easy as all the contributors could review the pull requests locally and point out bugs and issues in the implementation and suggest changes that can be made, in a particular implementation. It made technical discussion very smooth and easy.
